The night sky over TopCity can be viewed as a two-dimensional plane.<br></br>
There are <b>N</b> stars in the sky.
Each star is a point, and the points are all distinct.<br></br>
The coordinates of the stars are (<b>X</b>[0], <b>Y</b>[0]), (<b>X</b>[1], <b>Y</b>[1]), ..., (<b>X</b>[<b>N</b>-1], <b>Y</b>[<b>N</b>-1]).
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Mr. X, a photographer, is going to make a collection of pictures of the sky.<br></br>
Each picture he is going to take will be a rectangle with sides are parallel to the X-axis and Y-axis of the plane of the night sky.<br></br>
In other words, he will choose four <i>real numbers</i> XL, XR, YL, YR such that XL &lt; XR and YL &lt; YR, and he will take a picture containing all points (x, y) such that XL ≦ x ≦ XR and YL ≦ y ≦ YR.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Each star has a light of a slightly different color. Therefore, it is possible to tell one star from another in a picture.<br></br>
Two pictures are considered different if they contain a different combination of stars.<br></br>
In other words, two pictures are different if there is a star that is in one of them but not in the other.<br></br>
(If two pictures have different dimensions but contain the same subset of stars, they are considered identical.)
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Mr. X wants to make a collection of different pictures.<br></br>
Additionally, he does not want the empty picture. Each picture in his collection must contain at least one star.<br></br>
Calculate and return the largest possible number of pictures in the collection.

	In this example, Mr.X can add 10 kinds of pictures of sky of TopCity, as follows for examples:
	<ol>
		<li>When he set XL = 0.5, XR = 1.5, YL = 0.5, YR = 1.5, he can take a picture which contains 1st star.</li>
		<li>When he set XL = 1.5, XR = 2.5, YL = 0.5, YR = 1.5, he can take a picture which contains 2nd star.</li>
		<li>When he set XL = 2.5, XR = 3.5, YL = 0.5, YR = 1.5, he can take a picture which contains 3rd star.</li>
		<li>When he set XL = 3.5, XR = 4.5, YL = 0.5, YR = 1.5, he can take a picture which contains 4th star.</li>
		<li>When he set XL = 1, XR = 2, YL = 0, YR = 2, he can take a picture which contains 1st and 2nd star.</li>
		<li>When he set XL = 2, XR = 3, YL = 0, YR = 2, he can take a picture which contains 2nd and 3rd star.</li>
		<li>When he set XL = 3, XR = 4, YL = 0, YR = 2, he can take a picture which contains 3rd and 4th star.</li>
		<li>When he set XL = 1, XR = 3, YL = 0, YR = 2, he can take a picture which contains 1st, 2nd, and 3rd star.</li>
		<li>When he set XL = 2, XR = 4, YL = 0, YR = 2, he can take a picture which contains 2nd, 3rd, and 4th star.</li>
		<li>When he set XL = -10, XR = 10, YL = -10, YR = 10, he can take a picture which contains 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th star.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
	In contrast, for example, it is impossible for him to take a picture of which contains 1st and 4th star only.<br></br>
	Also, note that he will not add a picture which contains no star into his collection.
