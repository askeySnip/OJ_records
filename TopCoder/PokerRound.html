Two players are playing poker.
At the beginning of the game, player 1 had X dollars and player 2 had Y dollars.
You know that X and Y were nonnegative integers such that X + Y = 10,000.
</p>
<p>
The players have already played three rounds of the game.
Each round looked as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Player 1 bet all the money they had.</li>
<li>Player 2 called. (That is, they bet the same amount of money.)</li>
<li>They revealed their hands. Player 1 won and received both bets.</li>
</ol>
<p>
You are given the int <b>T</b>.
Can player 2 have exactly <b>T</b> dollars after the third round of the game?
If they cannot, return -1.
Otherwise, compute and return Y: the amount of dollars player 2 had in the beginning.
(This value is always unique.)
